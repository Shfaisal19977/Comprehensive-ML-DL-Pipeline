# Comprehensive-ML-DL-Pipeline
"End-to-End Machine Learning and Deep Learning Pipeline with CNNs, RNNs, GANs, Reinforcement Learning, and More
his repository contains a complete pipeline for building, training, and evaluating a variety of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. It is designed to handle tasks ranging from data preprocessing to advanced models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Supports text, image, and tabular datasets, with built-in scaling, tokenization, and reshaping functions.
- **Model Building**:
  - Classification and Regression models (MLP, CNN, etc.)
  - Dimensionality reduction using PCA.
  - Ensemble learning with Random Forests.
  - RNNs with Attention mechanisms for NLP tasks.
  - GANs for generative tasks.
  - Q-learning for reinforcement learning tasks.
- **Distributed Training**: Uses TensorFlow's `tf.distribute` strategy for scalable model training.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From data preprocessing to model evaluation and advanced techniques like GANs and Reinforcement Learning.
